# Terra Backrooms

**Terra Backrooms** is a project designed to push the boundaries of what’s possible with the Terra plugin. It uses a simple yet powerful system to generate a Backrooms-like environment.

This pack is a derivative of *Infrooms*, a server project currently being developed by **Giuca002**. The goal of Terra Backrooms is to demonstrate to newer Terra users that the plugin is capable of much more than traditional terrain generation.

We welcome community contributions—whether it's creating new rooms, levels, or features—to help enhance the overall experience of the pack.

## Installation

Installing Terra Backrooms is similar to installing any other Terra pack. To get started, edit your `bukkit.yml` file and add the following code to set your default world to the Backrooms:

```
worlds:
  world:
    generator: Terra:BACKROOMS
```

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> You may spawn above the map upon first load. To resolve this, consider resetting the world spawn point manually or using a plugin to adjust it.

## Biomes

There are currently two main biomes available in the pack:

- `level_0`: An infinite maze of rooms and walls.
- `level_0_open`: A more open version of the Backrooms—ideal for building bases.

## Roadmap
Due to the many interpretations of how the Backrooms should look, we’ve decided to draw inspiration from all major wikis, canons, and media to create the ultimate Backrooms Terra pack. 

Below is a wishlist of features and ideas—some planned by **Giuca002**, and others we’d love to see contributed by the community.

- Levels beyond Level 0
- Multiple floors to Level 0?
- More Level 0 Biomes
- 100+ Schematics for Level 0 rooms
- Basic Datapack to add an entrance to The Backrooms and other levels
